# Presenter

Presenter is an Android application to run behavioural experiments. 

The app contains a list of steps and instruction to the participant, such as a list of destinations and probes. 
The app flow is self-paced and non-reversible. In other words, when the user (participant) completes an action the app proceeds to the next step. 

If you are a resaercher conducting behavioural experiments in the wild, for example running a wayfinding study in the city, this app allows to deliver standardised instructions to the participants withouth intervention from the researcher.
